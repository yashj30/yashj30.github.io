		Hi, I'm Yash — a cybersecurity professional with 5 years of experience securing applications, infrastructure, and cloud environments. I specialize in application security, threat modeling, and vulnerability management.
	</p>

	<p>
		This site is my space to share insights, practical guides, and walkthroughs on real-world security challenges. Whether it’s breaking down a vulnerability, analyzing threat patterns, or sharing tools and workflows, my goal is to contribute meaningfully to the security community.
	</p>

	<p>
		Outside of work, I enjoy staying on top of emerging threats, tinkering with security tools, and writing about what I learn. If you're into cybersecurity — whether you're just starting out or deep into your career — I hope you find something useful here.
	</p>

	<p>
		Thanks for stopping by!
